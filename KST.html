            Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark<br> about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast from Puri on the coastline of Odisha, India.<br> The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE.<br>

            Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex<br> has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone.<br> Once over 200 feet (61 m) high, much of the temple is now in ruins,<br> in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary;<br> at one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains.<br> The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. <br>Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga architecture.<br>
            
            The cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is unclear and still remains a source of controversy.<br> Theories range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple<br> in the course of being sacked several times by Muslim armies between the 15th and 17th centuries.<br> This temple was called the<u><i>"Black Pagoda"</i></u> in European sailor accounts as early as 1676 <br>because it looked like a great tiered tower which appeared black.<br> Similarly, the Jagannath Temple in Puri was called the<u><i>"White Pagoda"</i></u>.<br> Both temples served as important landmarks for sailors in the Bay of Bengal.<br> The temple that exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of British India-era archaeological teams.<br> Declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1984, it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus,<br> who gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of February.<br>
            
            Konark Sun Temple is depicted on the reverse side of the Indian currency <br>note of 10 rupees to signify its importance to Indian cultural heritage.
