            The Golden Temple (also known as the Harmandir Sahib, lit.'abode of God',<br> Punjabi pronunciation: , or the DarbƒÅr Sahib, 'exalted court',<br> is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.<br> It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism.<br>

            The gurdwara is built around a man-made pool (sarovar) that was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.<br> In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib.<br> The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution<br> and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan armies.<br> Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, <br>and overlaid the sanctum with Gold foil in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.<br>
            
            The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism.<br> It became a center of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s,<br> and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s,<br> the Gurdwara became a center of conflict between the Indian government led by Indira Gandhi,<br> some radical Sikh groups, and a movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.<br> In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star,<br> leading to deaths of over 1,000 soldiers and civilians, <br>as well as causing much damage to the Gurdwara and the destruction of Akal Takht. <br>The Gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.<br>
